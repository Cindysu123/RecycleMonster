# RecycleMonster
This is a group project, which we design and created an educational toy for kids to learn knowledge related to recycle. The toy includes an arduino board used for controlling display screen, two sensors, microphone, and led light. The child will recognize how to properly recycle trash based on the feedback given by the toy.
